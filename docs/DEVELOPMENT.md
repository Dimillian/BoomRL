# BoomRL Development Status

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Foundation - COMPLETED

### What's Working Now
- **Project Setup**: Complete Vite + Three.js environment
- **Basic Scene**: 3D environment with lighting and fog
- **Player Movement**: WASD movement with mouse look (FPS controls)
- **Level Generation**: Procedural maze-like levels with walls, floor, and ceiling
- **Weapon System**: Complete weapon framework with rarities and modifiers
- **UI System**: Retro-styled interface with HUD, menus, and notifications
- **Input System**: Full keyboard and mouse input handling with pointer lock

### Current Features

#### 🎮 Controls
- **WASD**: Movement
- **Mouse**: Look around (FPS style)
- **Left Click**: Shoot
- **R**: Reload
- **E**: Interact (placeholder)
- **Escape**: Menu toggle

#### 🗺️ Level System
- Procedural generation with maze-like structure
- Border walls and random internal obstacles
- Clear spawn area around player start
- Dynamic lighting with multiple point lights
- Collision detection system (basic)

#### 🔫 Weapon System
- **6 Weapon Types**: Pistol, Shotgun, Assault Rifle, SMG, Sniper, Plasma Rifle
- **5 Rarity Levels**: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary
- **10+ Modifiers**: Explosive, Piercing, Rapid, Precise, Vampiric, etc.
- **Dynamic Stats**: Damage, fire rate, accuracy, magazine size, reload time
- **Special Effects**: Framework for explosions, fire, electric chains

#### 🖥️ User Interface
- Retro green terminal aesthetic
- Real-time HUD with health, ammo, and weapon info
- Color-coded weapon rarities
- Menu system with start/upgrade/stats options
- Notification system for game events

### Current Limitations
1. **No Enemies**: Shooting works but there are no targets
2. **No Collision**: Player can walk through walls (needs physics)
3. **No Audio**: Silent gameplay (sound system not implemented)
4. **No Particles**: No visual effects for shots or explosions
5. **Basic Graphics**: Simple colored boxes for geometry

## 🎯 Next Development Phases

### Phase 2: Game Mechanics (Immediate Next Steps)
1. **Enemy AI System**
   - Basic enemy types (zombies, demons, etc.)
   - Simple AI behaviors (chase, attack, patrol)
   - Health and damage system

2. **Combat System**
   - Bullet physics and hit detection
   - Damage calculation and application
   - Visual feedback for hits and kills

3. **Enhanced Level Design**
   - Enemy spawn points
   - Item/weapon pickup locations
   - Exit portals to next level

### Phase 3: Roguelike Features
1. **Meta-progression**
   - Persistent upgrade system
   - Currency collection (scrap, energy cores)
   - Upgrade shop between runs

2. **Loot System**
   - Weapon drops from enemies
   - Rarity-based spawn rates
   - Item pickup mechanics

### Phase 4: Polish & Enhancement
1. **Audio System**
   - Weapon sound effects
   - Ambient music and atmosphere
   - UI sound feedback

2. **Visual Effects**
   - Muzzle flashes and bullet tracers
   - Explosion and impact particles
   - Blood and damage effects

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

4. **Start playing**: Click "START GAME" and use WASD + mouse to move around!

## 🔧 Development Notes

### Adding New Features
- **Enemies**: Create in `src/entities/Enemy.js`
- **Weapons**: Add templates to `WeaponSystem.js`
- **Levels**: Modify generation in `Level.js`
- **UI**: Extend `UIManager.js`

### Code Style
- ES6 modules with import/export
- Classes for major systems
- Console logging with emoji prefixes
- Event-driven architecture for input

### Performance Considerations
- Three.js object pooling for bullets/enemies
- Efficient collision detection
- Texture atlasing for sprites
- LOD system for distant objects
